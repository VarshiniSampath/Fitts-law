Fitts's Law is one of the cornerstones of user interface research. In 1954, Fitts described the relationship between the target distance, width, and time needed for a target acquisition task. This later became known as Fitts's law [Fitts 1954].

"Fitts-law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target.[1] Fitts's law is used to model the act of pointing, either by physically touching an object with a hand or finger, or virtually, by pointing to an object on a computer monitor using a pointing device."
