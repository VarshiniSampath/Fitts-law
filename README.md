Fitts's Law is one of the cornerstones of user interface research. In 1954, Fitts described the relationship between the target distance, width, and time needed for a target acquisition task. This later became known as Fitts's law [Fitts 1954].

It is used to mathematically model a human behavior and accurately predict the amount of time taken to move to and select a target. It is typically applied to movement of a cursor or some sort of a pointer on a graphical user interface.

This project is Fitts’s law experiment for aimed movement. The experiment is based on Simon Wallner’s experiment on Fitt’s law, with 3 different distances and 2 target widths.
